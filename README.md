# gHoG for Nuclei Detection and Cell Graph for Feature Extraction
Nuclei are detected using modified source code for the proposed gLoG method for nuclei detection published in IEEE-JBHI 2017 using determinant of Hessian instead of Laplacian. 26 graph features are extracted based on cell graph techniques.      

## How to Run
1. run MaingHoG_NucleiDec.m to detect seeds.
2. run cellgraph_feats_extract.ipynb for cell graph creation based seed coordinates
